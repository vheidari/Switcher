Switcher is an open-source add-on developed for Mozilla Firefox. This extension allows you to change the proxy settings in your browser with a click.


## What Switcher Brings to Your Browser: 
Here is a simple list of features that `Switcher` will bring to your browser.

1.   An easy way to switch between proxy modes (`No Proxy`, `System Proxy`, `Manual Proxy`).
2.   A simple, clean, and beautiful user interface based on `Firefox's` design.
3.   Displays current proxy settings through an `icon badge` (`N - Red`, `S - Green`, `M - Blue`).
4.   Navigate through proxy modes using a convenient keyboard shortcut `(Alt + Ctrl + S)`.
5.   A streamlined manual proxy settings form to effortlessly manage your manual proxy fields.
6.   Automatically saves proxy settings in your browser, fully synchronized with Firefox proxy settings.
7.   A `dynamic fields` handler that manages `Copy/Paste` and an `auto-saving mode`, which saves settings when you enter an address or paste it into the fields.
8.   Switch between proxy modes with a single click on the `proxy buttons`.
9.   Displays the current `HTTP proxy` that you have set for `manual` use.
10.   Permanently remembers your `proxy settings` even after closing `Firefox`.

11. `Dynamic OS detection` based on your operating system: `Linux`, `OpenBSD`, `FreeBSD`, `macOS`, or `Windows` and update system proxy icon.
